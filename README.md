CMPE-297 Sec 49 - Special Topics


This repository contains all artifacts related to AI projects using cutting-edge models such as Gemini, Claude 3.5, and GPT-4. Each section showcases specific tasks such as video summarization, multimodal demonstrations, and VC pitching.

## Project Structure

### a) Long Video Summarization and Medium Article Writing with Gemini

**Task:**
- Pick a large, state-of-the-art AI-related tech video (minimum few hours > 2 hours), like a conference talk, which has cutting-edge AI discussions done within the last 2 months.
- Follow the techniques mentioned in class: extract the transcript, pass it to Gemini, and generate a summary, key takeaways, and a Medium article.
- Create a LaTeX slideshow of the content summary in a presentable fashion.
- Use Gemini's long-form context for all tasks.
  
**Artifacts:**
- Transcript
- Summary
- Medium article
- LaTeX slideshow
- Demo video of the process

### b) Claude Dev - Extension Installation and Reproduction

**Task:**
- Install and pick the latest Claude Dev extension.
- Watch a few videos and choose one that you like the most.
- Try to install, reproduce, and record the final video process for a complex task (e.g., web app, mobile app, or similar).
- Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet extension for this.
  
**Artifacts:**
- Demo video of the process
- Code used

### c) Multimodal Capabilities of Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4.0

**Task:**
- Demonstrate the multimodal capabilities (video, audio, images, and text) of Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4.0 using Colab.
- Cover ten advanced features across ten different domains (e.g., coding, video generation, image generation, etc.).
  
**Artifacts:**
- Colab notebook with code
- Demo video of the entire process

### d) 10 Novel Use Cases of Gemini Long Context

**Task:**
- Showcase 10 very novel use cases of the long-context capabilities of Gemini.
- Write a Medium article with the help of Gemini on these use cases.
  
**Artifacts:**
- Medium article
- Colab notebook with demos
- Demo video of the use cases

---

### e) VC Pitch Using Claude 3.5

**Task:**
- Create a VC pitch related to all artifacts using Claude 3.5.
- Follow the example video shared in class to structure your pitch.
  
**Artifacts:**
- Demo video of the VC pitch
- Script and presentation slides

---

### f) 10 Use Cases of Coding Using Claude-Dev Extensions

**Task:**
- Showcase 10 use cases of Claude-Dev extensions in coding (e.g., refactoring, commenting, code generation, autocomplete, etc.).
  
**Artifacts:**
- Code generated from the use cases
- Demo video showcasing the process
